# Case Study - N26 # 

## Analysis Questions ##
1. Give an overview of our channels and how they contribute to user acquisition.
2. Estimate the impact of doubling TV spending
3. Make appropriate assumptions for the channel touchpoint cost. With your assumptions give recommendations how to change the budget allocation to maximize user acquisition with a constant budget

## Report ##

**Channels Overview**

1. The main acquisition driver is affiliate. 
2. However, 67% of all users have been acquired through two touch points
3. The most successful touch point pair was 'Affiliate - Social' bringing 40% of all acquisitions. 
   Affiliate by itself drove 20% of all acquisitions.
4. Social by itself doesn't generate acquisitions but combined with Affiliate becomes a successful cross-channel pair

**Proposal for Budget Allocation**

Considering that the 67% of all acquisitions in the time period between Jan and Apr 2017 occurred through 2 Touch Points and only 7% through 3 Touch Points, **I'd suggest investing budget on a two-cross-channel strategy to maximise acquisitions and minimise costs**.

**The budget should be invested on Social and CPC** which are the main channels increasing their acquisitions when working in pairs with Affiliate.

1. TV Campaign shows a positive impact on the overall acquisition.
2. TV campaigns generates a +28% uplift on the average acquisitions per day.
   
**Doubling TV Costs - Expectation**

Assuming that these observations are not coming from the same distribution and that the difference is not given by chance, **we should expect ~ 550 * 2 acquisitions** when doubling TV Costs.
