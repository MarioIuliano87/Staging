# Muenchen Price Analysis 

## Scope ##

This project goal is to outline exploration data analysis (EDA) steps to generate insights 
on a dataset. 

In this specific case, I'm imaging to be someone interested in having an air bnb in Muenchen and 
I need to explore the overall price distribution based on: 

- Listing locations 
- Listing characteristics
